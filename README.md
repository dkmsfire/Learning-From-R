1. Title: Learning From R

2. Abstract: Here I will record what I learn about new packages from R.

3. Packages: 
      
      --- ggplot2
         
         --- needless to say.
      
      --- gridExtra
      
         --- using this packages to get the effect like par(mfrow).
      
      --- rmarkdown
      
         --- a very good tool to write a beautiful report.
      
      --- shiny
      
         --- It's simple to learn how to write a web page and also we can publish our project on-line.
      
      --- mice
      
         --- to solve the missing value problems, we need to use mice to get a lot of methods to do NA imputation.
      
      --- openxlsx
      
         --- this is a very easy tool to output result by xlsx and sheets.
      --- logistic regression
      
         --- In many methods to draw a logistic regression plot, I found that using ggplot2 is the fastest way.
      
      --- randomForest
      
         --- randomForest is a very powerful method to do the classification, but we can't easily interpret the result, maybe a little by the importance of attributes.
      
      --- information retrieval
      
         --- in this section, we need the prior acknowledge about NLP and text mining.
